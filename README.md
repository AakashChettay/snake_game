Snake and Apple Game
This is a classic Snake and Apple game built using Python and Pygame. The objective of the game is to control a snake to eat apples, which causes the snake to grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself.

Features
Snake Movement: Control the snake using arrow keys to move left, right, up, or down.
Apple Generation: Apples appear randomly on the screen. Eating an apple increases the snake's length and score.
Collision Detection: The game detects collisions with the snake's body and ends the game if a collision occurs.
Background Music: The game includes a looping background music track that enhances the gaming experience.
Background Image: A visually appealing background image is rendered during gameplay.
